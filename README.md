# All Programming Assignments for CSCI567: Machine Learning, as taught by Michael Schindler at USC ✌️

This repository comprises of all 5 programming assignments from CSCI567: Machine Learning taught by Prof. Michael Schindler in Spring 2018 at the University of Southern California ✌️

  1. Implement a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (kNN), Perceptron algorithm, and Linear Regression to fit the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, and evaluate their performance. Learn how to set up a machine learning pipeline and evaluate their performance.
  2. Implement binary classification (using logistic regression), multiclass classification (using logistic multiclass regression), and Neural Networks (specifically a Multilayer Perceptron and a Convolution Neural Network) to fit a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
  3. Implement a linear support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification, AdaBoost, LogitBoost, and a decision tree classifier to fit the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
  4. Implement K-Means clustering on a toy dataset, use the K-means algorithm to compress an image, and implement a Gaussian Mixture Model to fit to the sklearn digits dataset.
  5. Implement hidden Markov Models' (HMM) inference procedures of possible hidden states given a small Markov Model's observations, and implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and use it for image compression.
